Graph
=====

> In Eclipse to make this *Graph into a jar just goto File > Export > Java > Runnable Jar
> The export distination can be Slingshot/lib/Live-Graph.jar
> I believe the name of the jar file has to be Live-Graph.jar if not then ....


> Other problems like "Noclassdef..." error occurs then to fix it goto:
> Slinshot's META-INF > MANIFEST.MF (select the MANIFEST.MF tab) then under Bundle-ClassPath: 
> add lib/Live-Graph.jar or another name that you might have called it.
