#PrimoGENI Constellation

PrimoGENI Constellation allows large-scale network experiments consisting of simulated and emulated components running real applications on GENI resources (www.geni.net). Network traffic generated by the applications is conducted on the virtual network and subjected to packet delays and losses in accordance with the simulated network conditions.
